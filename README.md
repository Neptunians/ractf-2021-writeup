It was really awesome to me and I had a lot of fun with some challenges. 

We finished in 16o place, with 6000 points solving:
* 5 out of 7 Web challenges
* All of the 6 OSINT
* 6 out of 7 Misc
* 6 out of 8 Pwn
* 1 out of 6 Stego

This time I'll make a small writeup of various web challenges that I worked in.
